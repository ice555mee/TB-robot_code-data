# TB-robot_code-data
TB robot classifiaction model was built based on ResNet50 architecture and trained with our datasets to be used for CV and GCD classification.
This repository is composed of 3 main folders as described in Files introduction.

## Files introduction
- CV Classification 
It includes the classification codes/models in Process 3, 4, and 5 as well as the training datasets.
For the dataset folders, it was the label data into 4 catagoried (50% battery and 100% battery for Process 4) (50% pseudocapacitor and 100% pseudocapacitor for Process 5) according to the classification processes described in the publication.

-GCD Classification
It includes the classification codes/models in Process 2.

-Matching title_signal
This folder provides codes for the matching (title vs. CV/GCD) experiment.
